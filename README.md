# 👋 Hi, I'm Ngobeni Khomotjo

I'm a software engineer focused on building **scalable, secure, and high-performance systems**.  
I enjoy working close to the metal when it matters, and higher-level abstractions when they help move fast.

Most of my work revolves around **distributed systems, backend infrastructure, and product-oriented engineering**.  
Some of the projects below are proprietary to my startup — descriptions are safe to share publicly.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

**Languages**
- 🦀 Rust — systems, security, backend services  
- 🐹 Go — distributed services, feeds, notifications  
- 🐍 Python  
- ⚙️ C++ — media & performance-heavy workloads  
- 💙 Dart / Flutter  
- 🌙 Lua — currently learning  

**Domains**
- End-to-end encryption (E2EE)  
- Identity & Access Management (IAM)  
- Social graphs & activity feeds  
- Search & indexing  
- Notification systems  
- Real-time presence (Go)  
- Media processing  
- Mobile app development

### 🟢 Real-Time Presence System (Go)
- Tracks online/offline/active users in real time  
- Multi-device aggregation with heartbeat and TTL-based liveness  
- Event-driven updates integrated with chat, feeds, and notifications  
- Designed for **eventual consistency**, high concurrency, and privacy-conscious propagation  

---

### 🎥 Media Processing (C++)
- Performance-focused pipelines for media ingestion and processing  
- Low-level latency and throughput optimizations  

---

### 📱 Social Media App (Flutter)
- Cross-platform mobile application  
- Integrates seamlessly with custom backend services  

---

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- Lua  
- Deeper distributed systems patterns  
- Improving media processing pipelines  

---

## 💡 Engineering Philosophy
- Prefer **correctness and clarity** over cleverness  
- Build systems that scale **by design**, not by accident  
- Security and performance are **features, not afterthoughts**
