# 👋 Hi, I'm Ngobeni Khomotjo

I'm a software engineer focused on building **scalable, secure, and high-performance systems**.  
I enjoy working close to the metal when it matters, and higher-level abstractions when they help move fast.

Most of my work revolves around **distributed systems, backend infrastructure, and product-oriented engineering**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

**Languages**
- 🦀 Rust (systems, security, backend services)
- 🐹 Go (distributed services, feeds, notifications)
- 🐍 Python
- 💙 Dart / Flutter
- ⚙️ C++ (media & performance-heavy workloads)
- 🌙 Lua (currently learning)

**Domains**
- End-to-end encryption (E2EE)
- Identity & Access Management (IAM)
- Social graphs & activity feeds
- Search & indexing
- Notification systems
- Media processing
- Mobile app development

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

### 🔐 End-to-End Encrypted Chat (Rust)
- Secure messaging system with a focus on privacy
- Custom cryptographic workflows
- Actively under development

### 🧩 Backend Platform (Rust & Go)
- **IAM platform** (authentication & authorization)
- **Social graph** & relationship modeling
- **Search index**
- **Activity feed**
- **Notification system**
- **Content store**

Rust is used for core services and security-critical components,  
Go powers scalable, high-throughput services.

### 🎥 Media Processing (C++)
- Performance-focused media pipelines
- Low-level optimizations where latency and throughput matter

### 📱 Social Media App (Flutter)
- Cross-platform mobile application
- Integrated with custom backend services

---

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- Lua
- Deeper distributed systems patterns
- Improving media processing pipelines

---

## 💡 Engineering Philosophy
- Prefer **correctness and clarity** over cleverness
- Build systems that scale **by design**, not by accident
- Security and performance are features, not afterthoughts
